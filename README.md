# Machine Learning Course Zoomcamp

This repositry contains all notebooks, notes, homeworks and the mid-term project I have done during the four-month long course [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) designed and instructed by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) at [DataTalks.club](https://datatalks.club/).
