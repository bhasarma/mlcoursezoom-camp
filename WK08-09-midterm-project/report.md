## 1.1 Selecting a dataset

Fidning an interesting dataset to work with is not an easy task, specially when it is my first machine learning project ever. Before searching for a dataset, I set the following criterias to select a dataset:

- area of interest:
	- financial (crredit card, loan, insurance, bank etc.) 
	- e-commerce
	- social data (census etc.)
- number of features > 20 (not too simple data), but also not many e.g. 200-300.
- number of rows (instances)>20k (bigger is probably better)
- with both categorical and numerical variables
- with missing values
- either a catrgorical or a regression problem
- solves a buisness problem

I had the following sources to select a dataset from:

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
or, 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions

- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

- https://data.europa.eu/en

- https://www.openml.org/search?type=data

- https://www.data-is-plural.com/ 

- https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview

- [soccer data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)

Finally after lots of search, I decided to go with the following data:
