- AWS Lambda is not the only way of deploying models using this serverless fashion. Google cloud, Microsoft Azure provide something similar. In all cloud providers, we find similar services. We can experiment with that.

- We can also deploy other models e.g. in the homework we'll deploy the model that we trained in the previous session: dino or dragon classifier. We'll deploy it with AWS Lambda. 

- Last but not the least, it works well not just with deep learning models, but also for usual models such as linear regression, xgboost, scikit-learn preety much anything using AWS Lambda. We can play with that as well and e.g. for capstone project.
