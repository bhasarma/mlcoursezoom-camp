# 8.2 Tensorflow and Keras

Tensorflow is a library (more like a framework) for doing deeplearning. It is an end-to-end open source machine learning platform.  It can do othwer things, but main focus for this library is deep learning. So, Tensorflow is a library for training deep learning models. Keras is a higher level abstraction on top of tensorflow. Inside Tensorflow, we have Keras. It provides higher level abstraction which helps to create, train and use neural networks. Officila website of tensorflow is: [https://www.tensorflow.org/] (https://www.tensorflow.org/).

**Installing Tensorflow**
Tensorflow doesn't come with Anaconda. If we use Anaconda, we don't have tensorflow.

Install it from inside of Jupyter notebook with : `!conda install tensorflow -y`

Alternatively, you can install it with `!pip install tensorflow`
