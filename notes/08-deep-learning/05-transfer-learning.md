In this lesson we'll talk about transfer learning.

In the previous lesson, we talked about internals of neural networks. We talked about convolutional layers. Main purpose of convolutional layer is to convert image into a vector representationn  of the image by using one layer after another, each layer consisting of number of filters. 

Then we talked about dense layers. They take vector representation and use it for making prediction. 

In this lesson we'll see neural network, already trained on imagenet dataset.These filters are quite generic and
