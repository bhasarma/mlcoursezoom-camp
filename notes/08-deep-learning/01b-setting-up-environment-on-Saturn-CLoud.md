# 8.1b Setting up Environment on Saturn Cloud

In this session, we'll see how to train a neural network using a jupyter notebook with a GPU. In the videos of this module, that were recorded one year ago, we use AWS Sagemaker. Now with AWS it is actually difficult to get a Jupyter notebook with a GPU. We need to create a ticket, we need to ask for GPUs, we need to explain why we need a GPU and often support decline the request. 

We'll see here an alternative method with Saturn Cloud. Saturn Cloud offeres notebooks with a GPU.
