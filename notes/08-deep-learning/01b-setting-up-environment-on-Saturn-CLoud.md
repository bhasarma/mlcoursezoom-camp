# 8.1b Setting up Environment on Saturn Cloud

In this session, we'll see how to train a neural network using a jupyter notebook with a GPU. In other videos of this module, that were recorded one year ago, 
we used **AWS Sagemaker**. Now with AWS it is actually difficult to get a Jupyter notebook with a GPU. We need to create a ticket, we need to ask for GPUs, we need
to explain why we need a GPU and often support declines the request.

We'll see here an alternative method with **Saturn Cloud**. Saturn Cloud offeres notebooks with a GPU. 

Go to the link for sign-up for Saturn Cloud: [https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp](https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp).

Follow the rest of the video to set-up the notebook and to connect it with your github.
