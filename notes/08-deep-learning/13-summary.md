use case:

we use CNN for our use case.

we use tensorflow, which is library for training neural networks.

We use Keras, which is a higher level abstraction on top of tensorflow. We ddn't really use tensorflow. We used keras. Internall keras uses tensorflow for making all the things we did. 

We saw that many neural networks are already available. Somebody trained them and avaiable for us to use. We can build on top of this model. 

We built our first NN.
