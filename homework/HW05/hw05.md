## Question 1

* Install Pipenv
* What's the version of pipenv you installed?
* Use `--version` to find out

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DTRi60e.png)
figure 1. `pipenv`is installed on `base` environment in the directory `~/GitHub/mlcoursezoom-camp/homework/HW05$`. At this point, I don't know 1. if it matters, in which diretory I do the installation and 2. if I can have another python virtual environment in conda environment.

 figure 2: version of `pipenv` installed is `2022.10.4`
 
## Question 2

* Use Pipenv to install Scikit-Learn version 1.0.2
* What's the first hash for scikit-learn you get in Pipfile.lock?

Note: you should create an empty folder for homework and do it there.

figure 3: pipenv is used to install Scikit-Learn version 1.0.2 using the command `pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2`.

**Answer to question 2**
first hash for scikit-learn we get in `Pipfile.lock` is `"sha256": "c71abaddf023d2d7029f36beec9b8afb73c91860ff0002758fa66f8ea365dad0"`

## Models
We've prepared a dictionary vectorizer and a model.

They were trained (roughly) using this code:

```
features = ['reports', 'share', 'expenditure', 'owner']
dicts = df[features].to_dict(orient='records')

dv = DictVectorizer(sparse=False)
X = dv.fit_transform(dicts)

model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear').fit(X, y)
```

Note: You don't need to train the model. This code is just for your reference.
And then saved with Pickle. Download them:

* [DictVectorizer](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/course-zoomcamp/cohorts/2022/05-deployment/homework/dv.bin?raw=true)
* [LogisticRegression](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/course-zoomcamp/cohorts/2022/05-deployment/homework/model1.bin?raw=true)

With wget:
```
PREFIX=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/course-zoomcamp/cohorts/2022/05-deployment/homework
wget $PREFIX/model1.bin
wget $PREFIX/dv.bin
```

## Question 3
Let's use these models!

* Write a script for loading these models with pickle
* Score this client:
`{"reports": 0, "share": 0.001694, "expenditure": 0.12, "owner": "yes"}`

What's the probability that this client will get a credit card?

* 0.162
* 0.391
* 0.601
* 0.993

If you're getting errors when unpickling the files, check their checksum:

```
$ md5sum model1.bin dv.bin
3f57f3ebfdf57a9e1368dcd0f28a4a14  model1.bin
6b7cded86a52af7e81859647fa3a5c2e  dv.bin
```
Solution:
```{python}
# write a script for loading models with pickle
# q3.py
import pickle

model_file = 'model1.bin' 
dict_vect_file = 'dv.bin'
with open(model_file,'rb') as f_in: 
    model = pickle.load(f_in)

with open(dict_vect_file,'rb') as f_in: 
    dv = pickle.load(f_in)

client = {"reports": 0, "share": 0.001694, "expenditure": 0.12, "owner": "yes"}

X = dv.transform([client])
y_pred = model.predict_proba(X)[0,1]

print('input', client)
print('churn probability', y_pred)

```

**Answer to question 3**
`0.162`

## Question 4

Now let's serve this model as a web service

* Install Flask and gunicorn (or waitress, if you're on Windows)
* Write Flask code for serving the model
* Now score this client using `requests`:

```
url = "YOUR_URL"
client = {"reports": 0, "share": 0.245, "expenditure": 3.438, "owner": "yes"}
requests.post(url, json=client).json()
```

What's the probability that this client will get a credit card?

* 0.274
* 0.484
* 0.698
* 0.928

Solution:

**Figure**: installation of flask and gunicorn 

** Flask code for serving the model**

```{python}
# predict.py
# Homework 05 | Question 4
# let's serve the model as a webservice using Flask


import pickle

from flask import Flask
from flask import request
from flask import jsonify


model_file = 'model1.bin' 
dict_vect_file = 'dv.bin'

with open(model_file,'rb') as f_in: 
    model = pickle.load(f_in)

with open(dict_vect_file,'rb') as f_in: 
    dv = pickle.load(f_in)

app = Flask('churn')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    client = request.get_json()

    X = dv.transform([client])
    y_pred = model.predict_proba(X)[0, 1]
    churn = y_pred >= 0.5

    result = {
        'churn_probability': float(y_pred),
        'churn': bool(churn)
    }

    return jsonify(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=9696)

```
Then, 

`$ pipenv shell`

`$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app `

or in one line,

`pipenv run gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app`

#predict-test.py
#Homework 05 | Question 4
#let's serve the model as a webservice using Flask

import requests

url = 'http://localhost:9696/predict'

customer_id = 'xyz-123'
client = {"reports": 0, "share": 0.245, "expenditure": 3.438, "owner": "yes"}


response = requests.post(url, json = client).json() 
print(response)


if response['churn'] == True:
    print('sending promo email to %s' %('xyz-123'))
else:
    print('not sending promo email to %s' % customer_id)
```

**Answer to question 4**

`0.928`
