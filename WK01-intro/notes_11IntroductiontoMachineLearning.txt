Machine Learning Zoomcamp
Session #1.1
Introduction to Machine Learning

Predicting the price of a car
Features: 
Target: what we want to predict
How machine Learning is used to predict the price of a car? 
Meaning of various terms are relavant.
==============================
Session 1.2

Machine Learning Vs. Rule Based system in the context of a spam detection for emails

how to do feature detection
Defining Rules for a spam email

Prediction and confidence level
===============================
Session 1.3 Supervised Learning

All examples of price prediction, churn prediction are examples of supervised learning.
We talk abou different types of supervised machine learning: regression, classification, ranking etc. 

What is Supervised learning?

Feature matrix : X
Car Price problem is a regression probem
Any prediction not only price of a car, cost of a house are all regression problem.

CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM: Multiclass and Binary
We don't output a number, but predict a category. For example image classification of cats, dogs etc. For two, there is a subtype of classification problem called as binary classification problem.

Ranking problem: we will not talk much about it.e.g. amazon or ebay, pr ecommerce website such as olx website, google search page 
Binary classification is the most needed and used ML technique
==============================================================
1.4 CRISP-DM ML process
CRISP-DM = Cross Industry Standard Processing for Data Mining is a methodology that talks about how a machine learning project should be organized.
We will talk about from problem statement to deployment. There are 6 steps.
We will our standard spam example.
CRSIP: 
1. what business problem we want to solve? Do we ML at all? 'Sometimes, when we have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.'
Modelling: which model to choose, 1. Logistic regression, 2. Decision tree,3. Random forest, 4. Neural Network, 4. Or many others. 
==============================================================
 Session 1.5 
Modelling step: Model selection
How to select the suitable model?
Training Dataset+ Validation dataset = Total dataset
Multiple comparison problem: one model can get particularly lucky. This can happen in ML a lot. To guard against this, we take another 20% of data for testing. So 60, 20, 20 for training, validation and testing.
